# Light Simulation Convolution Filters

A repository of simulations and image filters, produced in the context of a PhD research on optics and type design.

## Linear Filters (Processing)

### Halation
Simulates light propagation according to the inverse square law.

### Lens Blur
Generalized lens blur that assumes the kernel as a disc.

### Sinc Blur
Image filter that convolves a radially revolved sinc function with an image. A generalized, though not accurate, circular aperture diffraction simulation.

## FFT Filters (Python / OpenCV / Numpy)

### Halation
Simulates light propagation according to the inverse square law.

### Lens Blur
Generalized lens blur that assumes the kernel as a disc.

### Diffraction
Image filter that convolves the PSF of a diffracted aperture with an image.
